# AppleDataAnalysis
Tech Stack: Python, MySQL, Apache Spark (PySpark), Delta Lake, Databricks

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Apple-related datasets using scalable data engineering practices. The solution was implemented on the Databricks platform, leveraging PySpark for ETL processing, and deployed across both Data Lake and Lakehouse architectures.

**ðŸš€ Features**

 ETL Pipelines with PySpark
Built robust ETL pipelines using Apache Spark on Databricks for scalable data ingestion and transformation.

 Multi-Format Data Integration
Integrated datasets from various formats including CSV, Parquet, and Delta Tables using a Factory Design Pattern for a flexible reader module.

 Business Logic & Transformation
Applied complex business logic and data transformations using PySpark DataFrame API and Spark SQL.

 Storage Architecture
Final transformed data was written to both Data Lake and Data Lakehouse environments for optimized querying and analytics.
